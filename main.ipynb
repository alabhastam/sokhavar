    "# 🪶 Persian Mashāʿereh Chatbot (ELIZA‑Style Regex Bot)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Project Overview\n",
    "This project simulates a classical Persian **مشاعره (poetry chain game)** between a human and an AI chatbot modeled after **ELIZA**, one of the earliest rule‑based conversational agents.  \n",
    "In traditional Mashāʿereh, players exchange poetic verses; each new verse must **start with the same letter** that the previous verse **ended with**.  \n",
    "Our chatbot uses **regex pattern matching** and a dataset of Persian poetry (Rumi, Saadi, Hafez, Khayyam, Ferdowsi, etc.) to respond intelligently with the next verse.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 Core Idea\n",
    "- The bot can perform a convenient poem, both correct and related to the concept of the poem.\n"
